My First Website 
This is my first hands on Web Devlopment. Whatever I could learn within 24hrs, I have learned and implemented it.
There might be some errors or mistake, Kindly feel free to tell me about it, because I want to go deep into the Web Development as it is very interesting.
I Thank Commutatus for giving me opportunity to work on website Devlopment, long ago I wanted to learn but somehow it vanished, but now as
I got the task i got the enthusiasm to compete.
 
Thanks a lot
